  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 3, 29 June 2007

  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
  the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
  License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
  General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
  by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
  of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
  Application with the Library.The particular version of the Library
  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
  Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
  and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
  version:

  a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
  ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
  function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

  b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
  this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  a header file that is part of the Library.You may convey such object
  code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
  (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
  covered by this License.

  b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
  document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  the following:

  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
  covered by this License.

  b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
  document.

  c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
  execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
  these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
  copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

  d) Do one of the following:

  0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
  License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
  suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
  recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
  the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
  manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
  Corresponding Source.

  1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
  a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
  system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
  of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
  Version.

  e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
  be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
  GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
  necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
  Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
  Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
  you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
  the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
  Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
  Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
  for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  choice, if you do both of the following:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
  conveyed under the terms of this License.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
  is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
  accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
  apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
  permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
  Library.

  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 3, 29 June 2007

  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
  software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.By contrast,
  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
  software for all its users.We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
  any other work released this way by its authors.You can apply it to
  your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.Therefore, you have
  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
  freedoms that you received.You must make sure that they, too, receive
  or can get the source code.And you must show them these terms so they
  know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
  that there is no warranty for this free software.For both users' and
  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
  authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
  can do so.This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
  protecting users' freedom to change the software.The systematic
  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.Therefore, we
  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
  products.If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
  make it effectively proprietary.To prevent this, the GPL assures that
  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.Each licensee is addressed as "you"."Licensees" and
  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  exact copy.The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  computer or modifying a private copy.Propagation includes copying,
  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  parties to make or receive copies.Mere interaction with a user through
  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.If
  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
  for making modifications to it."Object code" means any non-source
  form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
  is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
  implementation is available to the public in source code form.A
  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
  control those activities.However, it does not include the work's
  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
  which are not part of the work.For example, Corresponding Source
  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
  subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
  Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
  same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  conditions are met.This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
  permission to run the unmodified Program.The output from running a
  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
  content, constitutes a covered work.This License acknowledges your
  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
  in force.You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
  not control copyright.Those thus making or running the covered works
  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
  the conditions stated below.Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
  makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
  measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
  technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
  it, and giving a relevant date.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
  released under this License and any conditions added under section
  7.This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
  "keep intact all notices".

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
  License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.This
  License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
  additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
  regardless of how they are packaged.This License gives no
  permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
  invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
  Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
  work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
  beyond what the individual works permit.Inclusion of a covered work
  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
  parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
  in one of these ways:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
  Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
  customarily used for software interchange.

  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
  written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
  long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
  model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
  copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
  product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
  medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
  more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
  conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
  Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
  written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.This
  alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
  only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
  with subsection 6b.

  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
  place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
  Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
  further charge.You need not require recipients to copy the
  Corresponding Source along with the object code.If the place to
  copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
  may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
  that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
  clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
  Corresponding Source.Regardless of what server hosts the
  Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
  available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
  Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
  charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
  into a dwelling.In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.For a particular
  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.A product
  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
  the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.The information must
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
  modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
  by the Installation Information.But this requirement does not apply
  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
  been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.Access to a
  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
  protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
  unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
  that they are valid under applicable law.If additional permissions
  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
  this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
  it.(Additional permissions may be written to require their own
  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)You may place
  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
  terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
  author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
  Notices displayed by works containing it; or

  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
  requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
  reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
  authors of the material; or

  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
  trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
  material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
  it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
  any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
  those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.If the Program as you
  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
  restriction, you may remove that term.If a license document contains
  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
  not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
  where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
  the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License.Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
  paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
  your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  this License.If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
  material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  run a copy of the Program.Ancillary propagation of a covered work
  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.However,
  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
  modify any covered work.These actions infringe copyright if you do
  not accept this License.Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
  propagate that work, subject to this License.You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  organization, or merging organizations.If propagation of a covered
  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
  rights granted or affirmed under this License.For example, you may
  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.The
  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.For
  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
  this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
  propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
  sue for patent infringement).To "grant" such a patent license to a
  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
  patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
  license to downstream recipients."Knowingly relying" means you have
  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
  country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
  work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
  specifically granted under this License.You may not convey a covered
  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot convey a
  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
  not convey it at all.For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.The terms of this
  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
  combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  the GNU General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the
  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
  Foundation.If the Program does not specify a version number of the
  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
  by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
  to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
  permissions.However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
  later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
  IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
  copy of the Program in return for a fee.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program.If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

  <program>Copyright (C) <year><name of author>
  This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.Of course, your program's commands
  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
  into proprietary programs.If your program is a subroutine library, you
  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
  the library.If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
  Public License instead of this License.But first, please read
  <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 3, 29 June 2007

  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
  the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
  License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
  General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
  by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
  of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
  Application with the Library.The particular version of the Library
  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
  Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
  and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
  version:

  a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
  ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
  function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

  b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
  this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  a header file that is part of the Library.You may convey such object
  code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
  (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
  covered by this License.

  b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
  document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  the following:

  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
  covered by this License.

  b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
  document.

  c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
  execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
  these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
  copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

  d) Do one of the following:

  0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
  License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
  suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
  recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
  the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
  manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
  Corresponding Source.

  1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
  a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
  system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
  of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
  Version.

  e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
  be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
  GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
  necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
  Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
  Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
  you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
  the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
  Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
  Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
  for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  choice, if you do both of the following:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
  conveyed under the terms of this License.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
  is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
  accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
  apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
  permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
  Library.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 3, 29 June 2007

  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
  software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.By contrast,
  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
  software for all its users.We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
  any other work released this way by its authors.You can apply it to
  your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.Therefore, you have
  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
  freedoms that you received.You must make sure that they, too, receive
  or can get the source code.And you must show them these terms so they
  know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
  that there is no warranty for this free software.For both users' and
  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
  authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
  can do so.This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
  protecting users' freedom to change the software.The systematic
  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.Therefore, we
  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
  products.If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
  make it effectively proprietary.To prevent this, the GPL assures that
  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.Each licensee is addressed as "you"."Licensees" and
  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  exact copy.The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  computer or modifying a private copy.Propagation includes copying,
  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  parties to make or receive copies.Mere interaction with a user through
  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.If
  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
  for making modifications to it."Object code" means any non-source
  form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
  is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
  implementation is available to the public in source code form.A
  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
  control those activities.However, it does not include the work's
  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
  which are not part of the work.For example, Corresponding Source
  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
  subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
  Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
  same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  conditions are met.This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
  permission to run the unmodified Program.The output from running a
  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
  content, constitutes a covered work.This License acknowledges your
  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
  in force.You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
  not control copyright.Those thus making or running the covered works
  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
  the conditions stated below.Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
  makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
  measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
  technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
  it, and giving a relevant date.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
  released under this License and any conditions added under section
  7.This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
  "keep intact all notices".

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
  License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.This
  License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
  additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
  regardless of how they are packaged.This License gives no
  permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
  invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
  Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
  work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
  beyond what the individual works permit.Inclusion of a covered work
  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
  parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
  in one of these ways:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
  Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
  customarily used for software interchange.

  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
  written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
  long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
  model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
  copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
  product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
  medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
  more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
  conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
  Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
  written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.This
  alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
  only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
  with subsection 6b.

  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
  place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
  Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
  further charge.You need not require recipients to copy the
  Corresponding Source along with the object code.If the place to
  copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
  may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
  that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
  clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
  Corresponding Source.Regardless of what server hosts the
  Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
  available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
  Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
  charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
  into a dwelling.In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.For a particular
  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.A product
  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
  the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.The information must
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
  modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
  by the Installation Information.But this requirement does not apply
  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
  been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.Access to a
  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
  protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
  unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
  that they are valid under applicable law.If additional permissions
  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
  this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
  it.(Additional permissions may be written to require their own
  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)You may place
  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
  terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
  author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
  Notices displayed by works containing it; or

  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
  requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
  reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
  authors of the material; or

  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
  trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
  material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
  it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
  any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
  those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.If the Program as you
  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
  restriction, you may remove that term.If a license document contains
  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
  not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
  where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
  the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License.Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
  paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
  your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  this License.If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
  material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  run a copy of the Program.Ancillary propagation of a covered work
  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.However,
  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
  modify any covered work.These actions infringe copyright if you do
  not accept this License.Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
  propagate that work, subject to this License.You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  organization, or merging organizations.If propagation of a covered
  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
  rights granted or affirmed under this License.For example, you may
  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.The
  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.For
  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
  this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
  propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
  sue for patent infringement).To "grant" such a patent license to a
  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
  patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
  license to downstream recipients."Knowingly relying" means you have
  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
  country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
  work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
  specifically granted under this License.You may not convey a covered
  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot convey a
  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
  not convey it at all.For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.The terms of this
  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
  combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  the GNU General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the
  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
  Foundation.If the Program does not specify a version number of the
  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
  by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
  to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
  permissions.However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
  later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
  IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
  copy of the Program in return for a fee.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program.If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

  <program>Copyright (C) <year><name of author>
  This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.Of course, your program's commands
  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
  into proprietary programs.If your program is a subroutine library, you
  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
  the library.If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
  Public License instead of this License.But first, please read
  <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  How to Apply the License to your Work

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year>
  <name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

The Group 3 fax stuff originated as code from Jef Poskanzer, but has since been rewritten several times. The latest version uses an algorithm from Frank Cringle -- consult libtiff/mkg3states.c and libtiff/tif_fax3.h for further information. The JPEG support was written by Tom Lane and is dependent on the excellent work of Tom Lane and the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) who distribute their work under friendly licensing similar to this software. Many other people have by now helped with bug fixes and code; a few of the more persistent contributors have been:

  Bjorn P. Brox
  Dan McCoy
  J.T. Conklin
  Richard Minner
  Frank D. Cringle
  Richard Mlynarik
  Soren Pingel Dalsgaard
  Niles Ritter
  Steve Johnson
  Karsten Spang
  Tom Lane
  Peter Smith
  Brent Roman
  Mike Welles
  Frank Warmerdam
  Greg Ward
  Stanislav Brabec
  Roman Shpount
  Peter Skarpetis
  Arvan Pritchard
  Bernt Herd
  Joseph Orost
  Phil Beffery
  Ivo Penzar
  Francois Dagand
  Albert Chin-A-Young
  Bruce A. Mallett

  Andrey Kiselev
  Ross Finlayson
  (my apology to anyone that was inadvertently not listed.)
  Warning

  It appears that Unisys is actively pursuing copyright control on the LZW compression algorithm. In particular, users of the LZW compression within the TIFF framework. For this reason the TIFF 6.0 spec states that LZW compression is not recommended. It is unclear at this time what compression algorithm will be used in place of it. I have no idea what this means to you or to this library. I make no warranty or guarantees with regard to the LZW support in this library.

liblzma

  XZ Utils Licensing
  ==================

  Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
  is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
  package (but check the individual files to be sure!):

  - liblzma is in the public domain.

  - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
  domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
  in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
  GNU LGPLv2.1+.

  - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
  adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
  under GNU GPLv2+.

  - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
  XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
  are in the public domain.

  - Translated messages are in the public domain.

  - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
  are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
  in the binaries being built.

  - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
  utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.

  - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
  that are under various free software licenses.

  You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
  the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
  take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
  the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
  lawyers.

  As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.

  If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
  into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
  polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
  naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
  notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:

  This software includes code from XZ Utils <https://tukaani.org/xz/>.

  The following license texts are included in the following files:
  - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
  - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
  - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3

  Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
  pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
  binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
  even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
  package.

  If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
  information.

  libjpeg-turbo Licenses

  libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:

  The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in README.ijg

  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)

  The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below

  This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as well as the build system.

  The zlib License

  This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo SIMD extensions.

  Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses

  This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the best of our understanding.

  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then:

  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices from the source.

  Origin

  Clause 1 of the IJG License
  Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
  Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License
  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

  Origin

  Clause 1 of the IJG License
  Clause 2 of the zlib License
  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the copyright or license text in that file.

  Origin

  Clause 1 of the IJG License
  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or if you are distributing an application that statically links with libjpeg-turbo, then:

  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

  This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.

  Origin

  Clause 2 of the IJG license
  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD License (see below.)

  Origin

  Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License
  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

  Origin

  IJG License
  Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License
  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable consequences resulting from your use of the software.

  Why Three Licenses?

  The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License. However, the IJG License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities. Thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR

  DAMAGES.

  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2, June 1991

  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA02111-1307USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the library GPL.It is
  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
  other libraries whose authors decide to use it.You can use it for
  your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
  you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link a program with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
  with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
  the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  library.If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
  version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
  the original authors' reputations.
  
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
  software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
  transforming the program into proprietary software.To prevent this,
  we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
  free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
  GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.This
  license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
  designated libraries.This license is quite different from the ordinary
  one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
  the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
  they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
  program and simply using it.Linking a program with a library, without
  changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
  analogous to running a utility program or application program.However, in
  a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
  derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
  treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
  Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
  sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.We
  concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
  users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
  libraries themselves.This Library General Public License is intended to
  permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
  preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
  libraries that are incorporated in them.(We have not seen how to achieve
  this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
  changes in the actual functions of the Library.)The hope is that this
  will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
  works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
  General Public License rather than by this special one.
  
  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
  General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is
  addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2, June 1991

  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA02111-1307USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the library GPL.It is
  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
  other libraries whose authors decide to use it.You can use it for
  your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
  you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link a program with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
  with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
  the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  library.If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
  version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
  the original authors' reputations.
  
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
  software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
  transforming the program into proprietary software.To prevent this,
  we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
  free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
  GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.This
  license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
  designated libraries.This license is quite different from the ordinary
  one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
  the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
  they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
  program and simply using it.Linking a program with a library, without
  changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
  analogous to running a utility program or application program.However, in
  a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
  derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
  treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
  Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
  sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.We
  concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
  users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
  libraries themselves.This Library General Public License is intended to
  permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
  preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
  libraries that are incorporated in them.(We have not seen how to achieve
  this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
  changes in the actual functions of the Library.)The hope is that this
  will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
  works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
  General Public License rather than by this special one.
  
  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
  General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is
  addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Library General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the
  Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330,
  Boston, MA02111-1307USA.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
  below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
  becomes a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must
  be allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
  compilation and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
  performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
  of the ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
  have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
  notice is found.


  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
  your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
  if necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
  Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2, June 1991

  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA02111-1307USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the library GPL.It is
  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
  other libraries whose authors decide to use it.You can use it for
  your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
  you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link a program with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
  with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
  the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  library.If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
  version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
  the original authors' reputations.
  
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
  software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
  transforming the program into proprietary software.To prevent this,
  we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
  free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
  GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.This
  license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
  designated libraries.This license is quite different from the ordinary
  one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
  the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
  they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
  program and simply using it.Linking a program with a library, without
  changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
  analogous to running a utility program or application program.However, in
  a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
  derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
  treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
  Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
  sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.We
  concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
  users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
  libraries themselves.This Library General Public License is intended to
  permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
  preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
  libraries that are incorporated in them.(We have not seen how to achieve
  this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
  changes in the actual functions of the Library.)The hope is that this
  will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
  works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
  General Public License rather than by this special one.
  
  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
  General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is
  addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Library General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the
  Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330,
  Boston, MA02111-1307USA.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
  below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
  becomes a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must
  be allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
  compilation and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
  performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
  of the ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
  have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
  notice is found.


  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
  your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
  if necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
  below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
  becomes a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must
  be allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
  compilation and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
  performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
  of the ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2, June 1991

  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the library GPL.It is
  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
  other libraries whose authors decide to use it.You can use it for
  your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
  you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link a program with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
  with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
  the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  library.If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
  version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
  the original authors' reputations.
  
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
  software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
  transforming the program into proprietary software.To prevent this,
  we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
  free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
  GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.This
  license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
  designated libraries.This license is quite different from the ordinary
  one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
  the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
  they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
  program and simply using it.Linking a program with a library, without
  changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
  analogous to running a utility program or application program.However, in
  a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
  derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
  treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
  Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
  sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.We
  concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
  users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
  libraries themselves.This Library General Public License is intended to
  permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
  preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
  libraries that are incorporated in them.(We have not seen how to achieve
  this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
  changes in the actual functions of the Library.)The hope is that this
  will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
  works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
  General Public License rather than by this special one.
  
  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
  General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is
  addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Library General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
  Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
  becomes a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must
  be allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
  compilation and installation of the library.
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.
  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  ^L
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  ^L
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:
  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)
  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
  performing this distribution.
  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.
  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  ^L
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.
  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  ^L
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  ^L
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.
  NO WARRANTY
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  ^L
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
  of the ordinary General Public License).
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
  have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
  notice is found.
  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>
  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.
  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307USA
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
  your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
  if necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
  Random Hacker.

  59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA02111-1307USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]
  Preamble
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
  below.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  ^L
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many

  that program using a modified version of the Library.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a

  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.
  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  ^L
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  ^L
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:
  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)
  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
  performing this distribution.
  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.
  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  ^L
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.
  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  ^L
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  ^L
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.
  NO WARRANTY
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  ^L
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
  of the ordinary General Public License).
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
  have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
  notice is found.
  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>
  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.
  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307USA
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
  your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
  if necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
  Random Hacker.
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice
  That's all there is to it!

  PCRE2 LICENCE
  -------------

  PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
  and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

  Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the "BSD"
  licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
  redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory,
  is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the
  testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

  The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
  included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
  optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
  the library is built.

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

libcairo

  Cairo is free software.

  Every source file in the implementation[*] of cairo is available to be
  redistributed and/or modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser
  General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public
  License (MPL) version 1.1.Some files are available under more
  liberal terms, but we believe that in all cases, each file may be used
  under either the LGPL or the MPL.

  See the following files in this directory for the precise terms and
  conditions of either license:

  COPYING-LGPL-2.1
  COPYING-MPL-1.1

  Please see each file in the implementation for copyright and licensing
  information, (in the opening comment of each file).

  [*] The implementation of cairo is contained entirely within the "src"
  directory of the cairo source distribution. There are other components
  of the cairo source distribution (such as the "test", "util", and "perf")
  that are auxiliary to the library itself. None of the source code in these
  directories contributes to a build of the cairo library itself, (libcairo.so
  or cairo.dll or similar).

  These auxiliary components are also free software, but may be under
  different license terms than cairo itself. For example, most of the
  test cases in the perf and test directories are made available under
  an MIT license to simplify any use of this code for reference purposes
  in using cairo itself. Other files might be available under the GNU
  General Public License (GPL), for example. Again, please see the COPYING
  file under each directory and the opening comment of each file for copyright
  and licensing information.

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

libstdc++

  License

  There are two licenses affecting GNU libstdc++: one for the code, and one for the documentation.

  There is a license section in the FAQ regarding common questions. If you have more questions, ask the FSF or the gcc mailing list.

  The Code: GPL

  The source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, with the addition under section 7 of an exception described in the ‚ÄúGCC Runtime Library Exception, version 3.1‚Äù as follows (or see the file COPYING.RUNTIME):


  GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

  Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

  Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
  permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
  3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
  bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
  the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

  When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
  certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
  program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
  non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
  header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

  0. Definitions.

  A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
  Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
  interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
  on the Runtime Library.

  "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
  modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
  the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
  subsequent versions published by the FSF.

  "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
  modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
  the license of GCC.

  "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
  target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
  input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
  phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
  format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
  for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

  The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
  non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
  Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
  use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
  part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
  understood as starting with the output of the generators or
  preprocessors.

  A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
  with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
  work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
  optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
  Eligible Compilation Process.

  1. Grant of Additional Permission.

  You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
  combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
  propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
  all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
  may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
  consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

  2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

  The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
  presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
  requirements of the license of GCC.


  Hopefully that text is self-explanatory. If it isn't, you need to speak to your lawyer, or the Free Software Foundation.

  The Documentation: GPL, FDL

  The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the web, excluding the pages generated from source comments, are copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, and placed under the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3. There are no Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

  For documentation generated by doxygen or other automated tools via processing source code comments and markup, the original source code license applies to the generated files. Thus, the doxygen documents are licensed GPL.

  If you plan on making copies of the documentation, please let us know. We can probably offer suggestions.

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.The ordinary
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.The Lesser General
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
  the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
  Public License.It also provides other free software developers Less
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.These disadvantages
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
  libraries.However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
  special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
  a de-facto standard.To achieve this, non-free programs must be
  allowed to use the library.A more frequent case is that a free
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.In this
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
  free software.For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
  system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
  that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
  be combined with the library in order to run.
  
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
  which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
  and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
  writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
  and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
  Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
  fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
  in the event an application does not supply such function or
  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
  its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
  application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
  root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
  instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
  that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in
  these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
  the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
  library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
  work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
  this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
  directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one
  of these things:

  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
  executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood
  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
  to use the modified definitions.)

  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
  Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
  copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
  rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
  will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
  the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
  interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
  least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
  than the cost of performing this distribution.

  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
  specified materials from the same place.

  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
  reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
  accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
  distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
  facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the
  Sections above.

  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
  rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
  subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
  implemented by public license practices.Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
  the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
  the Free Software Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
  write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
  everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
  ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year><name of author>

  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU
  Lesser General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA02110-1301USA

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
  necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

  That's all there is to it!

================================================================================

libgcc_s

  License

  There are two licenses affecting GNU libstdc++: one for the code, and one for the documentation.

  There is a license section in the FAQ regarding common questions. If you have more questions, ask the FSF or the gcc mailing list.

  The Code: GPL

  The source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, with the addition under section 7 of an exception described in the ‚ÄúGCC Runtime Library Exception, version 3.1‚Äù as follows (or see the file COPYING.RUNTIME):


  GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

  Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

  Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
  permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
  3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
  bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
  the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

  When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
  certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
  program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
  non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
  header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

  0. Definitions.

  A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
  Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
  interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
  on the Runtime Library.

  "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
  modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
  the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
  subsequent versions published by the FSF.

  "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
  modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
  the license of GCC.

  "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
  target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
  input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
  phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
  format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
  for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

  The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
  non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
  Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
  use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
  part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
  understood as starting with the output of the generators or
  preprocessors.

  A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
  with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
  work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
  optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
  Eligible Compilation Process.

  1. Grant of Additional Permission.

  You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
  combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
  propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
  all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
  may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
  consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

  2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

  The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
  presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
  requirements of the license of GCC.


  Hopefully that text is self-explanatory. If it isn't, you need to speak to your lawyer, or the Free Software Foundation.

  The Documentation: GPL, FDL

  The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the web, excluding the pages generated from source comments, are copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, and placed under the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3. There are no Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

  For documentation generated by doxygen or other automated tools via processing source code comments and markup, the original source code license applies to the generated files. Thus, the doxygen documents are licensed GPL.

  If you plan on making copies of the documentation, please let us know. We can probably offer suggestions.
