# Getting the image info![pro](/assets/pro.svg)

imgproxy can fetch and return a source image info without downloading the whole image.

## URL format

To get the image info, use the following URL format:

```
/info/%signature/plain/%source_url
/info/%signature/%encoded_source_url
```

### Signature

A signature protects your URL from being modified by an attacker. It is highly recommended to sign imgproxy URLs in a production environment.

Once you set up your [URL signature](configuration.md#url-signature), check out the [Signing the URL](signing_the_url.md) guide to learn about how to sign your URLs. Otherwise, since the signature is required, feel free to use any string here.

### Source URL
#### Plain

The source URL can be provided as is, prepended by `/plain/` part:

```
/plain/http://example.com/images/curiosity.jpg
```

**üìùNote:** If the source URL contains a query string or `@`, you'll need to escape it.

#### Base64 encoded

The source URL can be encoded with URL-safe Base64. The encoded URL can be split with `/` as desired:

```
/aHR0cDovL2V4YW1w/bGUuY29tL2ltYWdl/cy9jdXJpb3NpdHku/anBn
```

#### Encrypted with AES-CBC

The source URL can be encrypted with the AES-CBC algorithm, prepended by the `/enc/` segment. The encrypted URL can be split with `/` as desired:

```
/enc/jwV3wUD9r4VBIzgv/ang3Hbh0vPpcm5cc/VO5rHxzonpvZjppG/2VhDnX2aariBYegH/jlhw_-dqjXDMm4af/ZDU6y5sBog
```

## Response format

imgproxy responses with a JSON body and returns the following info:

* `format`: source image/video format. In case of video - list of predicted formats divided by comma
* `width`: image/video width
* `height`: image/video height
* `size`: file size. Can be zero if the image source doesn't set `Content-Length` header properly
* `exif`: Exif data
* `iptc`: IPTC data
* `video_meta`: metadata from the video

**üìùNote:** There are lots of IPTC tags in the spec, but imgproxy supports only a few of them. If you need some tags to be supported, just contact us.

#### Example (JPEG)

```json
{
  "format": "jpeg",
