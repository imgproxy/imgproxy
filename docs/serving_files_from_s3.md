# Serving files from S3

imgproxy can process images from S3 buckets. To use this feature, do the following:

1. Set the `IMGPROXY_USE_S3` environment variable to be `true`.
2. [Set up the necessary credentials](#set-up-credentials) to grant access to your bucket.
3. _(optional)_ Specify the AWS region with `IMGPROXY_S3_REGION` or `AWS_REGION`. Default: `us-west-1`
4. _(optional)_ Specify the S3 endpoint with `IMGPROXY_S3_ENDPOINT`.
5. Use `s3://%bucket_name/%file_key` as the source image URL.

If you need to specify the version of the source object, you can use the query string of the source URL:

```
s3://%bucket_name/%file_key?%version_id
```

### Set up credentials

There are three ways to specify your AWS credentials. The credentials need to have read rights for all of the buckets given in the source URLs:

#### IAM Roles

If you're running imgproxy on an Amazon Web Services platform, you can use IAM roles to to get the security credentials to make calls to AWS S3.

* **Elastic Container Service (ECS):** Assign an [IAM role to a task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html).
* **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):** Assign a [service account to a pod](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-configuration.html).
* **Elastic Beanstalk:** Assign an [IAM role to an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-instanceprofile.html).

#### Environment variables

You can specify an AWS Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key by setting the standard `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

``` bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=my_access_key AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=my_secret_key imgproxy

# same for Docker
docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=my_access_key -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=my_secret_key -it darthsim/imgproxy
```

This is the recommended method when using dockerized imgproxy.

#### Shared credentials file

Alternatively, you can create the `.aws/credentials` file in your home directory with the following content:

```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = %access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = %secret_access_key
```

## Minio

[Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio) is an object storage server released under Apache License v2.0. It is compatible with Amazon S3, so it can be used with imgproxy.

To use Minio as source images provider, do the following:

* Set up Amazon S3 support as usual using environment variables or a shared config file.
* Specify an endpoint with `IMGPROXY_S3_ENDPOINT`. Use the `http://...` endpoint to disable SSL.
