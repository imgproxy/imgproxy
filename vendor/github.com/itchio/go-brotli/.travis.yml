# This .travis.yml file looks complicated, because it is! Here's what it does:
#   - Build a `gbr` binary for darwin/amd64, linux/386+amd64, and windows/386+amd64
#     (windows builds are cross-compiled from linux thanks to mingw-w64)
#   - Run `go test` for all packages on darwin/amd64 and linux/amd64
#   - Works even though cgo crosscompilation is a bit of a mess

# this installs go via gimme, travis's go downloader
# gimme is able to build cross-compiling go toolchains,
# but does not support cgo afaict, so we're only using
# it to get gox to do our bidding.
